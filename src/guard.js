// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Plausibility of an energy index (`energy`, kWh), the value Gladys bills. Pure.
// The IndexGuard of gladys-p1-monitor (src/guard.js, approved), unchanged but
// for one thing: the highest plausible power is a parameter (`maxKw`, checked:
// INDEX_MAX_KW of src/constants.js, 10 kW for a plug, 25 kW for a meter alone,
// the default).
//
// The core turns the deltas of an `energy-sensor` / `index` (or `switch` /
// `energy`) feature into consumption and cost: it skips a delta below zero (a
// counter reset) but counts every rise IN FULL. So 312 → 0 → 312 kWh is
// billed as 312 kWh at once, and so is 312 → 3 (a drop taken) → 312. The rules:
// - a value of 0 (or below) is never published;
// - a value plausible after the last one published (not lower, not more than
//   `maxKw` on average since then) goes through; a value EQUAL to it goes
//   through without moving its date, so that a frozen reading never shrinks
//   the margin of the next real rise;
// - a drop and a jump up are NEVER confirmed by repetition nor by time: they
//   are held (the last accepted value is sent again), shown on the badge of
//   the device, kept in /data across restarts, and taken only on an explicit
//   gesture of the user (`acceptHeld`, the "Accept the held index" action);
// - the acceptance is BOUNDED: it covers the value shown (`held.to`, read at
//   `held.at`) and what the device may have drawn since (`maxKw` × hours +
//   INDEX_SLACK_KWH), nothing else: a jump taken is counted once as
//   consumption, a drop taken gives the core a negative delta (nothing
//   billed) and the values rise from there. A value outside the bounds is
//   held again and the acceptance dropped;
// - while a jump is held, every value at or above it stays held: the margin
//   growing while nothing is published must never cover it;
// - a value back to the usual rule (the drop or the jump was a glitch) ends
//   the hold, but only within the margin counted from the hold itself: with
//   an old reference, a value under a held jump that does not fit that short
//   margin is held in its turn (its kWh shown), never taken.
